Development Environment install and configuration using dotfiles and nvim

I am too lazy to create this workflow now...

Before executing install from fish, set DEV_ENV before `set -gx DEV_ENV (pwd)`

For `install` or `run` scripts there is `grep` **filter**. So, you can use as `./run zsh make cmake` to install only intended ones.
